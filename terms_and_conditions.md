This Channex Customer Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between you and channex.io Ltd (**09250795**) Trading as Channex (“Channex”). If you are agreeing to this Agreement not as an individual but on behalf of your company, then “Customer” or “you” means your company, and you are binding your company to this Agreement.

## 7. Hosted Services Terms.

7.1 Access to Hosted Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Channex grants you a non-exclusive right to access and use the Hosted Services during the applicable Subscription Term (as defined below) in accordance with this Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use and the Documentation. If Channex offers client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) for any Hosted Service, you may use such software solely with the Hosted Service, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You acknowledge that our Hosted Services are on-line, subscription-based products and that we may make changes to the Hosted Services from time to time.

7.2 Subscription Terms and Renewals. Hosted Services are provided on a subscription basis for a set term specified in your Order (“Subscription Term”). Except as otherwise specified in your Order, all subscriptions will automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term (and you will be charged at the then-current rates) unless you cancel your subscription through your account. If you cancel, your subscription will terminate at the end of then-current billing cycle, but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.

7.3 Credentials. You must ensure that all Authorised Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Hosted Services strictly confidential and not share such information with any unauthorised person. User IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared. You are responsible for any and all actions taken using your accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify Channex of any unauthorised use of which you become aware.

7.4 Your Data. “Your Data” means any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of any type that you upload, submit or otherwise transmit to or through Hosted Services. You will retain all right, title and interest in and to Your Data in the form provided to Channex. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you hereby grant to Channex a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to (a) collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create derivative works of Your Data, in each case solely to the extent necessary to provide the applicable Hosted Service to you and (b) for Hosted Services that enable you to share Your Data or interact with other people, to distribute and publicly perform and display Your Data as you (or your Authorised Users) direct or enable through the Hosted Service. Channex may also access your account or instance in order to respond to your support requests.

7.5 Security. Channex implements security procedures to help protect Your Data from security attacks. However, you understand that use of the Hosted Services necessarily involves transmission of Your Data over networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of Your Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks. We cannot guarantee that our security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions of Your Data will always be secure or that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our third party service providers.

7.7 Responsibility for Your Data.

7.7.1 General. You must ensure that your use of Hosted Services and all Your Data is at all times compliant with our Acceptable Use Policy and all applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations (“Laws”). You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide all Your Data to Channex and to grant the rights granted to Channex in this Agreement and (ii) Your Data and its transfer to and use by Channex as authorised by you under this Agreement do not violate any Laws (including without limitation those relating to export control and electronic communications) or rights of any third party, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of publicity, and any use, collection and disclosure authorised herein is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy policies. Other than its security obligations under Section 7.5 (Security), Channex assumes no responsibility or liability for Your Data, and you shall be solely responsible for Your Data and the consequences of using, disclosing, storing, or transmitting it.

7.7.2 Sensitive Data. You will not submit to the Hosted Services (or use the Hosted Services to collect): (i) any personally identifiable information, except as necessary for the establishment of your Channex account; (ii) any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by HIPAA or any similar federal or state laws, rules or regulations; or (iii) any other information subject to regulation or protection under specific laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (or related rules or regulations) ((i) through (iii), collectively, “Sensitive Data”). You also acknowledge that Channex is not acting as your Business Associate or subcontractor (as such terms are defined and used in HIPAA) and that the Hosted Services are not HIPAA compliant. “HIPAA” means the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended and supplemented. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Channex has no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive Data.

7.7.3 Indemnity for Your Data. You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Channex from and against any loss, cost, liability or damage, including attorneys’ fees, for which Channex becomes liable arising from or relating to any claim relating to Your Data, including but not limited to any claim brought by a third party alleging that Your Data, or your use of the Hosted Services in breach of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law. This indemnification obligation is subject to your receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Channex at your expense.

7.8 Removals and Suspension. Channex has no obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the Hosted Services. Nonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on your violation of this Agreement or in response to takedown requests that we receive following our guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Hosted Services or (2) suspend your access to the Hosted Services. We will generally alert you when we take such action and give you a reasonable opportunity to cure your breach, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Hosted Service or other users, we may suspend your access immediately without notice. You will continue to be charged for the Hosted Service during any suspension period. We have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Hosted Services as described in this section.

7.9 Deletion at End of Subscription Term. We may remove or delete Your Data within a reasonable period of time after the termination of your Subscription Term.

7.10 Service-Specific Terms. Some of our Hosted Services may be subject to additional terms specific to that service as set forth in our Service-Specific Terms.

## 8. Support and Maintenance.

Channex will provide the support and maintenance services for the Products described in the Channex Support Policy (“Support and Maintenance”) during the period for which you have paid the applicable fee. Support and Maintenance is subject to the terms of the Channex Support Policy and will be provided at the support level and during the support term specified in your Order. The Channex Support Policy may be modified by Channex from time to time to reflect process improvements or changing practices. Support and Maintenance for Software includes access to New Releases, if and when available. You may use any New Releases that we provide to you during a valid support term in the same way that you use Software, and New Releases are included in the definition of Software in that case. “New Releases” are bug fixes, patches, major or minor releases, or any other changes, enhancements, or modifications to the Software that we make generally commercially available.

## 9. Training Services.

We will provide Technical training for those services set forth in the Order and the accompanying service descriptions or datasheets (“Ancillary Services”). Channex shall retain all right, title and interest in and to any materials, deliverables, modifications, derivative works or developments related to any training services we provide (“Training Materials”). Any Training Materials provided to you may be used only in connection with the Products subject to the same use restrictions for the Products. If applicable, you will reimburse Channex for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as incurred.

## 10. Returns and Financial Terms.

10.1 Return Policy. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, it is our customary business practice to allow customers to return a Product within 30 days of payment for any reason or no reason and to receive a refund of the amount paid for the returned Product. In the context of Software, a return means that we will disable the license key that allowed the Software to operate. In the context of Hosted Services, a return means that we will disable access to the Hosted Service. We will not accept returns after the 30-day return period. You understand that Channex may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 26 (Changes to this Agreement).

10.2 Delivery. We will deliver the applicable license keys (in the case of Software) or login instructions (in the case of Hosted Services) to the email addresses specified in your Order when we have received payment of the applicable fees. All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic. For the avoidance of doubt, you are responsible for installation of any Software, and you acknowledge that Channex has no further delivery obligation with respect to the Software after delivery of the license keys.

10.3 Payment. You agree to pay all fees in accordance with each Order. Unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will pay all amounts in U.S. dollars at the time you place your Order. Other than as expressly set forth in Section 10.1 (Return Policy) and Section 20 (IP Indemnification by Channex), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable. In making payments, you acknowledge that you are not relying on future availability of any Products beyond the current License Term or Subscription Term or any Product upgrades or feature enhancements. If you add Authorised Users during your License Term or Subscription Term, we will charge you for the increased number of Authorised Users pursuant to the then-currently applicable rates in your next billing cycle. You agree that we may bill your credit card for renewals, additional users, and unpaid fees, as applicable. If you purchase any Products through a Reseller, you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that we may terminate your rights to use Products if we do not receive our corresponding payment from the Reseller.

10.4 Taxes. Your payments under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Channex, you must pay to Channex the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In that case, you will have the right to provide to Channex any such exemption information, and Channex will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable you to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.

## 11. No-Charge Products.

We may offer certain Products to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined below (“No-Charge Products”). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted for the period designated by us. You may not use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis or similar purposes. We may terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta products we make available (“Beta Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Products. We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 11 (No-Charge Products). All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of Beta Versions constitutes Channex’s Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support and Maintenance, warranty, and indemnity obligations.

## 12. Restrictions.

Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not: (a) rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, distribute, sell, sublicense, transfer, or provide access to the Products to a third party, (b) use the Products for the benefit of any third party, (c) incorporate any Products into a product or service you provide to a third party, (d) interfere with any license key mechanism in the Products or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Products intended to limit your use, (e) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to any Products, except as permitted by law, (f) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Product, or (g) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Products.

## 13 Your Development of Add-Ons.

13.1 License to Developer Guides. From time to time, Channex may publish SDK’s or API’s and associated guidelines (“Developer Guides”) to allow you to develop plugins, extensions, add-ons or other software products or services that interoperate or are integrated with the Products (“Add-Ons”). You may distribute your Add-Ons to third parties, but only for those Products permitted by Channex.

13.2 Conditions to Development of Add-Ons. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Channex has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to your Add-Ons or their combination, interaction or use with the Products. You shall indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against us by a third party relating to your Add-Ons (including but not limited to any representations or warranties you make about your Add-Ons) or your breach of this Section.

## 14 License Certifications and Audits.

At our request, you agree to provide a signed certification that you are using all Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including the Scope of Use. You agree to allow us, or our authorised agent, to audit your use of the Products. We will provide you with at least 10 days advance notice prior to the audit, and the audit will be conducted during normal business hours. We will bear all out-of-pocket costs that we incur for the audit, unless the audit reveals that you have exceeded the Scope of Use. You will provide reasonable assistance, cooperation, and access to relevant information in the course of any audit at your own cost. If you exceed your Scope of Use, we may invoice you for any past or ongoing excessive use, and you will pay the invoice promptly after receipt. This remedy is without prejudice to any other remedies available to Channex at law or equity or under this Agreement. To the extent we are obligated to do so, we may share audit results with certain of our third party licensors or assign the audit rights specified in this Section to such licensors.

## 15 Ownership and Feedback.

Products are made available on a limited license or access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”. Channex and its licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products (including all No-Charge Products), their “look and feel”, any and all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing created by or for Channex, including without limitation as they may incorporate Feedback (“Channex Technology”). From time to time, you may choose to submit comments, information, questions, data, ideas, description of processes, or other information to Channex, including sharing Your Modifications or in the course of receiving Support and Maintenance (“Feedback”). Channex may in connection with any of its products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement limits Channex’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

## 16 Confidentiality.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (“Receiving Party”) by the disclosing party (“Disclosing Party”) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure. Any Channex Technology and any performance information relating to the Products shall be deemed Confidential Information of Channex without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorised herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party’s nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not operate as a separate warranty with respect to the operation of any Product.

## 17 Term and Termination.

This Agreement is in effect for as long as you have a valid License Term or Subscription Term (the “Term”), unless sooner terminated as permitted in this Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement before the expiration of the Term if the other party materially breaches any of the terms of this Agreement and does not cure the breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach. Either party may also terminate the Agreement before the expiration of the Term if the other party ceases to operate, declares bankruptcy, or becomes insolvent or for any reason with a 30 day notice. You may terminate this Agreement at any time with notice to Channex, but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds as a result of convenience termination for prepaid but unused Software, Hosted Services subscriptions, or Support and Maintenance. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise. Once the Agreement terminates, you (and your Authorised Users) will no longer have any right to use or access any Products, or any information or materials that we make available to you under this Agreement, including Channex Confidential Information. You are required to delete any of the foregoing from your systems as applicable (including any third party systems operated on your behalf) and provide written certification to us that you have done so at our request. The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement: Sections 7.7.3 (Indemnity for Your Data), 10.3 (Payment), 10.4 (Taxes), 11 (No-Charge Products) (disclaimers and use restrictions only), 12 (Restrictions), 13.2 (Conditions to Development of Add-Ons), 14 (License Certifications and Audits), 15 (Ownership and Feedback), 16 (Confidentiality), 17 (Term and Termination), 18.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 19 (Limitation of Liability), 21 (Third Party Vendor Products), 24 (Dispute Resolution), 25 (Export Restrictions), and 27 (General Provisions).

## 18 Warranty and Disclaimer.

18.1 Due Authority.

18.2 WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. ALL PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND CHANNEX AND ITS SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FUNCTIONALITY, OR MERCHANTABILITY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW. Channex SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Channex. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER Channex NOR ANY OF ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE AS TO THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, TRUTH, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY PRODUCTS OR ANY CONTENT THEREIN OR GENERATED THEREWITH, OR THAT: (A) THE USE OF ANY PRODUCTS WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; (B) THE PRODUCTS WILL OPERATE IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, OR DATA; (C) THE PRODUCTS (OR ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE PRODUCTS) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS); (D) ANY STORED DATA WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE OR THAT ANY STORED DATA WILL NOT BE LOST OR CORRUPTED; (E) ERRORS OR DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR (F) THE PRODUCTS (OR ANY SERVER(S) THAT MAKE A HOSTED SERVICE AVAILABLE) ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

## 19 Limitation of Liability.

NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, COSTS OF DELAY OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. NEITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER SHALL EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO US FOR PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE IN THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS SHALL BE US$20. THIS SECTION 19 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) SHALL NOT APPLY TO (1) AMOUNTS OWED BY YOU UNDER ANY ORDERS, (2) EITHER PARTY’S EXPRESS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR (3) YOUR BREACH OF SECTION 12 (RESTRICTIONS) OR SECTION 2 (COMBINING THE PRODUCTS WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE) OF THIRD PARTY CODE IN Channex PRODUCTS). TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO SUPPLIERS OF ANY THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS INCLUDED IN THE PRODUCTS WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER. The parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 19 (Limitation of Liability) will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

## 20 IP Indemnification by Channex.

We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party alleging that a Product, when used as authorised under this Agreement, infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright (a “Claim”), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to settlement by Channex (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a Claim, provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the claim, including providing us a copy of the claim and all relevant evidence in your possession, custody or control; and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the claim. If your use of a Product is (or in our opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: (i) procure a license for your continued use of the Product in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) substitute a substantially functionally similar Product; or (iii) terminate your right to continue using the Product and refund, in the case of Software, the license fee paid by you as reduced to reflect a three year straight-line depreciation from the license purchase date, and in the case of a Hosted Service, any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. Channex’s indemnification obligations above do not apply: (1) if the total aggregate fees received by Channex with respect to your license to Software or subscription to Hosted Services in the 12 month period immediately preceding the claim is less than US$50,000; (2) if the Product is modified by any party other than Channex, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the Product is used in combination with any non-Channex product, software or equipment, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorised use of Products; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) Your Data (or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in Section 7.7.3 (Indemnity for Your Data)) or (z) any third-party deliverables or components contained with the Products; (6) to any unsupported release of the Software; or (7) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a claim without Channex’s prior written consent. THIS SECTION 20 (IP INDEMNIFICATION BY Channex) STATES OUR SOLE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PRODUCT OR OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY Channex UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

## 21 Third Party Vendor Products.

Channex or third parties may from time to time make available to you (e.g., through the Channex Marketplace) third-party products or services, including but not limited to add-ons and plugins as well as implementation, customisation, training, and other consulting services. If you procure any of these third party products or services, you do so under a separate agreement (and exchange of data) solely between you and the third party vendor. Channex does not warrant or support non-Channex products or services, whether or not they are designated by Channex as “verified” or otherwise, and disclaims all liability for such products or services. If you install or enable any third party products or services for use with Channex products, you acknowledge that Channex may allow the vendors of those products and services to access Your Data as required for the interoperation and support of such add-ons with the Channex products. Channex shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Your Data resulting from any such access by third party add-on vendors.

## 22 Publicity Rights.

We may identify you as an Channex customer in our promotional materials. We will notify you first. 


## 23 Improving Our Products.

We are always striving to improve our Products. In order to do so, we need to measure, analyse, and aggregate how users interact with our Products, such as usage patterns and characteristics of our user base. We collect and use analytics data regarding the use of our Products as described in our Privacy Policy.

## 24 Dispute Resolution

24.1 Dispute Resolution; Arbitration. In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognising their mutual interests, attempt to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall proceed to binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The parties shall seek to mutually appoint an arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then there shall be three (3) arbitrators: one selected by each party, and a third selected by the first two. Arbitration will take place in the following cities as mutually agreed between the parties: London (UK). All negotiations and arbitration proceedings pursuant to this Section will be confidential and treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar rules and codes of evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

24.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the United Kingdom.

As used herein, “including” (and its variants) means “including without limitation” (and its variants).

To describe exactly what we mean by “misuse” or “abuse” – and help us identify such transgressions, and react accordingly – we’ve created this Acceptable Use Policy. Under this policy, we reserve the right to remove content that is inconsistent with the spirit of the guidelines, even if it’s something that is not forbidden by the letter of the policy. In other words, if you do something that isn’t listed here verbatim, but it looks or smells like something listed here, we may still remove it.

You’ll see the word “services” a lot throughout this page. That refers to all websites owned or operated by Channex (such as Channex.io, and any related websites, sub-domains and pages) as well as any hosted services operated by Channex.

Use your judgment, and let’s be kind to each other so we can keep creating great things. You can find all the legal fine print at the bottom of this page.

## Security Policy

### Executive Overview

The Channex Connectivity Platform is designed to help Enterprises and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) securely connect channels and deliver them to hotels, customers, and or partners. Channex realizes that helping to protect our customer’s data, ensure proper security regulations, and mitigate any potential risk is essential to building trust and delivering a high-level of service. Channex takes a risk based approach to security and this paper will detail the many different measures and technologies in place to protect our customers.

Our security implementation allows us to adhere to the following best practices, demonstrating our commitment to customer security and privacy:

- Abides by the ISO27001 security technical specifications
- Abides by the PCI DSS security technical specifications
- Abides by the EU Data Directive by entering into Model Clauses with applicable customers, partners, and suppliers

### What Data Do We Store?

Channex only stores metadata about your organisation and your organisation’s properties and users.

We store the following data for the purpose of authentication:

Usernames and/or email addresses,

We store the following data for the purpose of channel management:

Property Details (Name, Address, Email, Facilities, Images, rooms types, rates plans and Availability, prices and restriction data.)

Booking Metadata (including if present: Customer name, guest names, customer address, customer card details),

### Defense in Depth
As you’ll see from any best-in-class SaaS provider, there is no single layer that protects customer data, but rather a well-architected solution that considers every layer from the physical security measures at the data center, all the way through the access privileges that determine what data an individual user can access. Channex, as a connectivity provider, uses this approach to protect customer data.

#### Process & Policy

The first layer of defense is having a well-defined and comprehensive set of security processes and policies to ensure the security of our customers’ data and users. Channex’s employs a number of process and policy measures that instill security as a key priority at our most core layer…. our people.

#### Change Control

A formal change control process minimises the risk associated with system changes. The process enables tracking of changes made to the systems and verifies that risks have been assessed, inter-dependencies are explored and necessary policies and procedures have been considered and applied before any change is authorised.

#### Training

Channex employees authorised to access the Channex platform undergo periodic training to focus employee attention to compliance with corporate security policies. For example, Channex DevOps and Professional Services personnel who may handle sensitive customer data and information will regularly undergo security, auditing, access, and compliance training (e.g. for GDPR)

#### Authorised Access

In addition to restricted personnel entering the production area, operational access is limited to only a restricted set of Channex operations employees. Access is controlled via a physically separate network that is isolated from the Channex corporate network that serves its general employee population ensuring that only personnel authorised to access the data centre may do so. All Channex personnel with physical or operational access to production environments are subject to training and all activities are logged for audit-ability.

#### Physical

All Channex data centres are certified to major InfoSec standards, including ISO 27001 and PCI DSS. These data centres also feature N+1 redundant HVAC and UPS. The physical security adheres to the best practices in the industry and include:

- Keycard protocols, biometric scanning protocols, and around-the-clock interior and exterior surveillance
- Access limited to authorised datacenter personnel—no one can enter the production area without prior clearance and appropriate escort
- Every data centre employee undergoes thorough background security checks
- Infrastructure
- Between the physical datacenter layer and the Channex Enterprise Connectivity Platform application layer is the infrastructure that supports our solution. Throughout the infrastructure, security is implemented in a comprehensive and coordinated fashion to enhance the safety and security of customer data.
- Firewalls
- All network access to the virtual hosts is protected by a multi-layered firewall operating in a deny-all mode. Internet access is only permitted on explicitly opened ports for only a subset of specified virtual hosts. For an additional layer of security, all database servers reside behind an additional firewall.
- Networking
- Channex platform servers are allocated to the respective security groups, characterised by specific security settings (TCP/IP level), supplemented by individual instance level stateful firewalls. Separate VLANs are used to split production, testing and development environments as well as to segregate end-user and administrative traffic.
- Channex employs a three-tier security model:

#### Systems Hardening

Just like any SaaS offering, the Channex Enterprise Connectivity Platform utilises many well coordinated technologies to deliver our service, yet there may be many capabilities that are not required. Consistent with industry best practices, Channex DevOps closely inspects the entire solution to identify unnecessary services and remove and/or disable these capabilities to reduce vulnerabilities to security threats.

#### No Root Access

All customer access to the Channex Enterprise Connectivity Platform is controlled through user interfaces (UI), APIs, and/or dedicated tools. Use of any of these methods of access require a username and password with privileges appropriate for the requested access.

Customers do not have root or administrative access to any portion of the Enterprise Insights Platform technology stack and access is permitted only via the Enterprise Insights Platform application layer (UI or API).

#### Shutdown All Unnecessary Ports

As previously mentioned in the Firewalls section, any ports on any server and/or virtual host not required for the operation of the Channex Enterprise Connectivity Platform is disabled eliminating additional opportunities for external intrusion.

#### Security Patches

Channex has rigorous policies and procedures in place to update all components of the Channex Enterprise Connectivity Platform, including operating systems, VM hypervisors, middleware, databases, etc. with their vendors’ security patches.

#### Data Retention

Customer data is not stored for longer that it is needed.  We require data about properties, bookings and users to deliver accurate data visualisations, and remove this data either upon request, or after a period [30 days max] after the account is terminated.

Data is also removed if deemed out of date, or no longer valid.  This can happen from removal of connected services, termination of accounts, or other events originating from connected service providers.

Properties are removed after 3 months of no channels
Bookings will be deleted once they reach 3 month after departure date.

Availability, Rates and Restriction data is removed for past dates daily.

Credit Card information is held until 7 days after booking departure.

Account data (Username, password, properties, channels & bookings) will be deleted within 30 days of account cancellation or on request.

## Conclusion

Here at Channex, we pride ourselves on the vigilance we employ to protect our customers’ data assets and we continually stress that a mature security organisation requires coordinated dedication across technology, policy, procedures, and people. This dedication is underscored by the risk-based approach laid out in this document to demonstrate strength at every layer of security, minimising any potential vulnerability or weakness.

We want our customers to know their data is sufficiently protected by this approach and welcome the opportunity to discuss these practices and approaches further.
